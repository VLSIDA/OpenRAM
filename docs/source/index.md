## OpenRAM Dependencies
In general, the OpenRAM compiler has very few dependencies:
+ Git
+ Make
+ Python 3.5 or higher
+ Various Python packages (pip install -r requirements.txt)
+ Anaconda

Commercial tools (optional):
* Spice Simulator
    * Hspice  I-2013.12-1 (or later)
    * CustomSim 2017 (or later)
* DRC
    * Calibre 2017.3\_29.23
* LVS
    * Calibre 2017.3\_29.23



## Supported Technologies
* NCSU FreePDK 45nm
    * Non-fabricable but contains DSM rules
    * Calibre or klayout for DRC/LVS
* MOSIS 0.35um (SCN4M\_SUBM)
    * Fabricable technology
    * Magic/Netgen or Calibre for DRC/LVS
* Skywater 130nm (sky130)
    * Fabricable technology
    * Magic/Netgen or klayout



## Implementation
* Front-end mode
    * Generates SPICE, layout views, timing models
        * Netlist-only mode can skip the physical design too
    * Doesn't perform DRC/LVS
    * Estimates power/delay analytically
* Back-end mode
    * Generates SPICE, layout views, timing models
    * Performs DRC/LVS
        * Can perform at each level of hierarchy or at the end
    * Simulates power/delay
        * Can be back-annotated or not



## Technology and Tool Portability
* OpenRAM is technology independent by using a technology directory that
  includes:
    * Technology's specific information
    * Technology's rules such as DRC rules and the GDS layer map
    * Custom designed library cells (6T, sense amp, DFF) to improve the SRAM
      density.
* For technologies that have specific design requirements, such as specialized
  well contacts, the user can include helper functions in the technology
  directory.
* Verification wrapper scripts
    * Uses a wrapper interface with DRC and LVS tools that allow flexibility
    * DRC and LVS can be performed at all levels of the design hierarchy to
      enhance bug tracking.
    * DRC and LVS can be disabled completely for improved run-time or if
      licenses are not available.
