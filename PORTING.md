# Porting to a New Technology

If you want to support a new technology, you will need to create:
+ a setup script for each technology you want to use
+ a technology directory for each technology with the base cells

We provide two technology examples for [SCMOS] and [FreePDK45]. Each
specific technology (e.g., [FreePDK45]) should be a subdirectory
(e.g., $OPENRAM_TECH/freepdk45) and include certain folders and files:
* gds_lib folder with all the .gds (premade) library cells:
  * dff.gds
  * sense_amp.gds
  * write_driver.gds
  * cell_1rw.gds
  * replica\_cell\_1rw.gds
  * dummy\_cell\_1rw.gds
* sp_lib folder with all the .sp (premade) library netlists for the above cells.
* layers.map
* A valid tech Python module (tech directory with \_\_init\_\_.py and tech.py) with:
  * References in tech.py to spice models
  * DRC/LVS rules needed for dynamic cells and routing
  * Layer information
  * Spice and supply information
  * etc.
