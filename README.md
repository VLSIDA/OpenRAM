An open-source static random access memory (SRAM) compiler.

This is forked from github.com/VLSIDA/OpenRAM

# What is OpenRAM?
<img align="right" width="25%" src="images/SCMOS_16kb_sram.jpg">

OpenRAM is an award winning open-source Python framework to create the layout,
netlists, timing and power models, placement and routing models, and
other views necessary to use SRAMs in ASIC design. OpenRAM supports
integration in both commercial and open-source flows with both
predictive and fabricable technologies.

# Documentation

Please take a look at our presentation We have created a detailed
presentation that serves as our [documentation][documentation].
This is the most up-to-date information, so please let us know if you see
things that need to be fixed.

# Basic Setup

## Dependencies

The OpenRAM compiler has very few dependencies:
+ [Ngspice] 26 (or later) or HSpice I-2013.12-1 (or later) or CustomSim 2017 (or later)
+ Python 3.5 or higher
+ Python numpy (pip3 install numpy to install)
+ Python scipy (pip3 install scipy to install)

If you want to perform DRC and LVS, you will need either:
+ Calibre (for [FreePDK45])
+ [Magic] 8.3.27 or higher (for [SCMOS])
+ [Netgen] 1.5 (for [SCMOS])

You must set two environment variables: 
+ OPENRAM\_HOME should point to the compiler source directory. 
+ OPENERAM\_TECH should point to a root technology directory.

## Environment

For example add this to your .bashrc:

```
  export SW_PDK_ROOT=<path to PDK root>/sky130A
  export OPENRAM_HOME="$HOME/openram/compiler"
  export OPENRAM_TECH="$HOME/openram/technology"
```

You may also wish to add OPENRAM\_HOME to your PYTHONPATH:

```
  export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$OPENRAM_HOME"
```

We include the tech files necessary for [SCMOS]
SCN4M_SUBM. The [SCMOS] spice models, however, are generic and should
be replaced with foundry models.  If you are using [FreePDK45], you
should also have that set up and have the environment variable point
to the PDK. For example add this to your .bashrc:

```
  export FREEPDK45="/bsoe/software/design-kits/FreePDK45"
```

You may get the entire [FreePDK45 PDK here][FreePDK45].
If you are using [SCMOS], you should install [Magic] and [Netgen].
We have included the most recent SCN4M_SUBM design rules from [Qflow].

## Docker Image

**WARNING! Some OpenRAM dependency tools installed in the Docker image are out-of-date.**

We have a pre-configured Ubuntu [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image
available that has all tools installed for the [SCMOS] process. It is
available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vlsida/openram-ubuntu).
Please see 
[our README.md](https://github.com/VLSIDA/openram-docker-images/blob/master/README.md)
for information on how to use this docker image.

## Vagrant Image

We have a pre-configured Ubuntu [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) image
available that has all tools installed for the [SCMOS] process. 
Please see 
[our README.md](https://github.com/VLSIDA/openram-vagrant-image/blob/master/README.md)
for information on how to use this image.

# Basic Usage

Once you have defined the environment, you can run OpenRAM from the command line 
using a single configuration file written in Python. 

For example, create a file called *myconfig.py* specifying the following
parameters for your memory:

```
# Data word size
word_size = 2
# Number of words in the memory
num_words = 16

# Technology to use in $OPENRAM_TECH
tech_name = "scn4m_subm"

# You can use the technology nominal corner only
nominal_corner_only = True
# Or you can specify particular corners
# Process corners to characterize
# process_corners = ["SS", "TT", "FF"]
# Voltage corners to characterize
# supply_voltages = [ 3.0, 3.3, 3.5 ]
# Temperature corners to characterize
# temperatures = [ 0, 25 100]

# Output directory for the results
output_path = "temp"
# Output file base name
output_name = "sram_{0}_{1}_{2}".format(word_size,num_words,tech_name)

# Disable analytical models for full characterization (WARNING: slow!)
# analytical_delay = False

```

You can then run OpenRAM by executing:
```
python3 $OPENRAM_HOME/openram.py myconfig
```
You can see all of the options for the configuration file in
$OPENRAM\_HOME/options.py


# Unit Tests

Regression testing  performs a number of tests for all modules in OpenRAM.
From the unit test directory ($OPENRAM\_HOME/tests), 
use the following command to run all regression tests:

```
   python3 regress.py
```
To run a specific test:
```
   python3 {unit test}.py 
```
The unit tests take the same arguments as openram.py itself. 

To increase the verbosity of the test, add one (or more) -v options:
```
   python3 tests/00_code_format_check_test.py -v -t freepdk45
```
To specify a particular technology use "-t <techname>" such as
"-t freepdk45". The default for a unit test is scn4m_subm. 
The default for openram.py is specified in the configuration file.


# Porting to a New Technology

If you want to support a enw technology, you will need to create:
+ a setup script for each technology you want to use
+ a technology directory for each technology with the base cells 

We provide two technology examples for [SCMOS] and [FreePDK45]. Each
specific technology (e.g., [FreePDK45]) should be a subdirectory
(e.g., $OPENRAM_TECH/freepdk45) and include certain folders and files:
* gds_lib folder with all the .gds (premade) library cells:
  * dff.gds
  * sense_amp.gds
  * write_driver.gds
  * cell_6t.gds
  * replica\_cell\_6t.gds 
  * dummy\_cell\_6t.gds 
* sp_lib folder with all the .sp (premade) library netlists for the above cells.
* layers.map 
* A valid tech Python module (tech directory with \_\_init\_\_.py and tech.py) with:
  * References in tech.py to spice models
  * DRC/LVS rules needed for dynamic cells and routing
  * Layer information
  * Spice and supply information
  * etc.
